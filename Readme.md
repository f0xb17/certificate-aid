# Certificate Aid for Arch Linux

This little script can save your ass if you have deleted your certificates (e.g., through system cleanup). I'm not asking why or why not. But it can help you.

## Usage

Simply execute and hope. That's all you have left either way.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/f0xb17/certificate-aid.git
$ cd certificate-aid
$ chmod 755 help-me.sh
$ ./help-me.sh
```
